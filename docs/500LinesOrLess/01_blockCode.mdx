在基于块的编程语言中，你通过拖动和连接表示程序不同部分的块编写程序的。基于块的编程语言不同于传统编程语言，在常规编程语言中你需要输入字符。

In block-based programming languages, you write programs by dragging and connecting blocks that represent parts of the program. Block-based languages differ from conventional programming languages, in which you type words and symbols.

学习一门编程语言可能会很难，因为它们不能容忍丝毫的错别字。大多数的编程语言是区分大小写的, 语法晦涩难懂, 并且如果在错误的地方多写了一个分号程序就会拒绝执行，更糟糕的是少写了一个分号。更有甚者, 现在的大多数编程语言是基于英语的，并且它们的语法不能本地化。

Learning a programming languages can be difficult because they are extremely sensitive to even the slightest of typos. Most programming languages are case-sensitive, have obscure syntax, and will refuse to run if you get so much as a semicolon in the wrong place or worse leave one out. Further, most programming languages in use today are based on English and their syntax cannot be localized.

相反，一个出色的基于块的编程语言可以完全消除语法错误。你仍然会创建执行错误的程序，

In contrast, a well-done block language can eliminate syntax errors completely. You can still create a program which does the wrong thing,
